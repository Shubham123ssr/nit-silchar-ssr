            The college is situated in the Barak valley. It is a beautiful place with an abundance of greenery and lakes all around.<br>
            The evening sunsets are a joy to watch here. The roads are clean a in good condition, Hostel is great.<br>
             Internet connectivity is more than needed. Professors and Phd students are helpful.<br>
              We have the best seniors here, They are very helpful.<br>
              Just thinking about the day when we will have to leave this college makes me feel sad.

            STUDENT REVIEW 
        </h1>
        <p>
            NIT Silchar in one word can be define was "heaven".Fillled with natural beauty it is one of the fastest developing NIT in India.<br>
            The faculties are extremely talanted and are extremely friendly and are ready for help at a any time.<br><br>
        
        
            The college have a lot of potential but due to its remote location it has suffered negligence from the rest part of the country.<br>
             Infrastructure is good. Better facilities should be there regarding research and internship.<br>
             Rather than focussing more on academics more should be given on projects, research and innovation.<br><br>
        
        
            Placement and Job oppurtunities is good especially in IT sector and semi govt company.<br>
             But with the PSU sector having stopped coming to NIT's , annual package for job has reduced drastically.
